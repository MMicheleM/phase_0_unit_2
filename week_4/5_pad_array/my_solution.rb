# Complete each step below according to the challenge directions and 
# include it in this file. Also make sure everything that isn't code
# is commented in the file.  

# I worked on this challenge by myself.

=begin
	
# 1. Pseudocode

# What is the input?
	Variety of methods to modify an array. Need to be be able to both
	overwrite and not overwrite during array modification. Need to be
	able to not pad an array under "X condition" as well as adding to
	the end of an array, padding with a string, an object or with nil.

# What is the output? (i.e. What should the code return?)
	In most cases it should return a modified array. Exceptions would 
	be when it's not meant to pad an array.

# What are the steps needed to solve the problem?
	Run test code to see initial error message. Tackle the test code 
	one test at a time by creating method(s) to address the tests.
